<td>  The Star has its heart in the right place but it is a dull movie. The story is dull, some of the characters are annoying, the animal humor has been done before, and there is no point to have villians in a Christian movie about the birth of Jesus... Unless you're talking about passion of the christ. It has okay animation, some of the other characters are good, there are a few laughs from me, the voice acting is surprisingly good, and there is a good soundtrack. 5/10 or 2.5 out of 5</td>

<td>  I was so excited to take two of our granddaughters to the animated movie, "The Star". (Especially since we have just been in Nazareth and Bethlehem). My excitement quickly faded. It attempts to depict the holy, holy story of Mary and Joseph with lots of slapstick and a hulking centurion with snarling dogs stalking and attempting to violently assassinate Mary on her way to Bethlehem, while lambs and donkeys and doves and camels successfully avert the bloodshed, send the bad guy down a cliff to his demise, and lead the dogs to repentance in the manger. I had so much to explain on the ride home. . . . The whole assassin thing really bothered me, and confused the girls. This was a totally manufactured story element, having Herod send out a henchman, who looked like an armored demon. (One granddaughter was trying to figure it out and recalled a time Herod did send out soldiers to kill in Bethlehem, but, hmmmm....). And oh, another fiction for the sake of added drama: Herod holds the Magi hostage, but their camels escape to tell the other animals Mary's life is in danger. Bottom line: You can't take the birth of Christ and turn it into a cartoon with a Road Runner and Wiley Coyote story line. It just fails on so many levels.</td>
