<td>  Although it had a lot of skeleton characters, it wasn't scared at all. Instead, it's so hilarious, colourful, warmhearted, and food for thought.It's great movie, even one of the best Pixar's films. However, it's still not suitable for younger kids(at least not for under 10 years old) as it contained about skeleton and death.</td>

<td>  Not a perfect movie, but definitely a worthy addition to Pixar's filmography. The animation is gorgeous, the characters are memorable, the story is somewhat cliched but very well-executed and entertaining, and the messages about memories and family are heartfelt. So far it's one of the best animated films in 2017.That Frozen short in the beginning was awful, though.</td>
