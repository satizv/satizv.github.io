<td>  They got a little confused with the basis for the Bad Moms idea, but the characters are likable and it was still funny. Christine Baranski was over the top.</td>

<td>  Going to this film was a sort of odd compromise -- we had not really intended to see it at a theater. However, because of the terrific cast, we went. There are moments of humor, mostly raw and, frankly, mostly because of who was saying the lines. This is an extremely poorly written and directed movie. There was a chance for this baby to be something, instead, the production team clearly strangled it in the cradle. Susan Sarandon got off a couple of real zinger lines, and the moments between her, Cheryl Hines, and Christine Baranski had some real power, and humor. I suspect there is a "Bad Grandmas" in Vegas movie idea percolating here.But overall, this movie is a profane, muddled mess masquerading as a movie.Don't bother seeing it in the theater, wait for it to come to cable, then skip it there as well.</td>
